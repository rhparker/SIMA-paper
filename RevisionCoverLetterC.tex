\opening{Dear Editor,}

On behalf of my co-authors, Todd Kapitula and Bj\"orn Sandstede, I would like to submit our third revision of the article ``A reformulated Krein matrix for star-even polynomial operators with applications'' for consideration of publication in SIAM J. Math. Anal.

We are grateful to the referees for their careful reading of the second revision. We have addressed the latest round of minor points brought up by the referees, and the corresponding revisions (on lines 30, 561, 566} are marked in red.  We hope that this last revision makes the paper acceptable for publication.

\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
